<h1>Crash2 Dataset</h1>
This publicly available clinical trial dataset of 20,207 patients was generously supplied by the <a href="https://ctu-app.lshtm.ac.uk/freebird"><tt>freeBIRD</tt></a> Bank of Injury and Emergency Research Data from the UK.  The CRASH-2 trandomized trial studied antifibrinolytic treatment in significant hemorrhage post trauma.

Note that simpler variable names have been used in the R dataset created from the study team's csv file.  The R file data dictionary is <a href="Ccrash2.html">here</a>.  This mainly involved dropping leading <tt>i</tt> from variable names.
